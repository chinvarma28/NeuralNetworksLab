# Part-A:

---

### 1.  Write a program to demonstrate the working of different activation functions like Sigmoid, Tanh, RELU and softmax to train neural network.

---
 
### 2a.  Design a single unit perceptron for classification of a linearly separable binary dataset without using pre-defined models. Use the Perceptron() from sklearn.
    
### 2b.  Identify the problem with single unit Perceptron. Classify using Or, And and Xor data and analyze the result.

---

### 3.  Build a Deep Feed Forward ANN by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets. Use the number of hidden layers >= 4.

---

### 4.  Design and implement a CNN model (with 4+ layers of convolutions) to classify multi category image datasets. Use the concept of regularization and dropout while designing the CNN model. Use the Fashion MNIST datasets. Record the Training accuracy and Test accuracy corresponding to the following architectures:
#### a. Base Model
#### b. Model with L1 Regularization
#### c. Model with L2 Regularization
#### d. Model with Dropout

---

### 5.  Design and implement an Image classification model to classify a dataset of images using Deep Feed Forward Neural Network. Record the accuracy corresponding to the number of epochs. Use the MNIST datasets.

---

### 6.  Implement Bidirectional LSTM for sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

---

### 7.  Implement the standard VGG-16 & 19 CNN architecture model to classify multi category image dataset and check the accuracy.
